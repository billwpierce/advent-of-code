# Some Thoughts On Advent

If you have no idea what advent is, check it out at http://adventofcode.com!

## Poor Code Quality

In general, I try to write good, well-annotated code.

This is not "in general".

For the sake of authenticity (and a bit because of laziness), all of the code here is presented how I wrote it day of (minus a little bit of cleanup).

## Citations

Not all of my code in advent is properly cited, as I'm trying to write the code quickly.

For example, my template code is modified off something given to me by http://github.com/leijurv, based on something used by another advent user.
